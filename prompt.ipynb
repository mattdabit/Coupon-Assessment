    "### Required Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’.  There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under \\\\$20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants (\\\\$20 - \\\\$50)."

    "### Missing Columns Analysis\n",
    "Concerning the dataset, I can see that only six columns contain missing data. These six columns include `Restaurant20to50`, `RestaurantLessThan20\"`, `CarryAway`, `CoffeeHouse`, `Bar` and `car`. All of these columns are categorical features. All but the `car` column are missing data less than or equal to `1.7%` of the time. The `car` column is the most sparse by being unavailable `99.1%` of the time. Considering these findings, I will drop the `car` column even though it can be useful to know. I simply can't impute that much data or assume the user is in a car with confidence. The five other columns concern the user's behavior and how often they visit that type of business. Even without visualizing the dataset I can infer that these columns are important and given that so few of these data are missing I ought to keep it. The question now is how to impute that data. One naive approach could be to impute the most frequent response or to impute a response of `never`, assuming that what the user meant. Either way these would be guesses. Another way of imputing these columns are to leverage a k-clustering algorithm. You would find the top 5 nearest neighbors of a row with missing values and impute the most frequent response of the nearest neighbors. This is an advance technique that I am not confident I can pull off just yet. I do know how to leverage SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) however that is for minority datasets and is a library I have used before. I mention SMOTE because it uses k-clustering to create synthetic data and my earlier suggestion was inspired by SMOTE. For the purpose of this project I will impute the most frequent response. Above is a table showing their most frequent responses. These have a frequency from `25%--50%`."

    "As I began to drill down into further categories, I began to unveil which features best represented the bar coupon acceptor minority group. I quickly found that those that accepted the bar coupon went to a bar more often than those that declined. This is intuitive. _People who go more often to a place are more willing to accept a coupon for that place than those that do not._\n",

    "The next feature I looked at was age. My gut feeling was that those under 25 would be people more likely to accept a bar coupon. However, I was wrong and it seems like I forgot what it is like to be 21–25. _People in this age group are either just starting their careers or are in college, meaning money is sparse and probably shouldn't be spent at a bar._ People in this group don't need to go to a bar to drink with friends, they can just drink beers or sip wine on the couch with their friends. I recollect that I didn't frequent bars at those ages simply because of cost. The following graph shows this disparity.\n",

    "These combinations of conditions represented a different kind of individual. We filtered out those who drove alone or with children. We then filter out those who worked in farming, fishing or forestry. I imagine these occupations are further away from city life. I also filtered out those that do not go to bars once a month. This shows a very different picture. _Users fitting these traits accepted the coupon at a very high rate._\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/bar_coupon_acceptance_by_avg_visits_and_occupation_and_passenger.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### More complicated categories\n",

    "Finally, I looked at drivers who met the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed *OR*\n",
    "- go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 *OR*\n",
    "- go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise shows us to not generalize entire populations without considering what makes individuals within that population unique. In short, you need to know your customer. Even within your targeted customer group, you will have sub groups/clusters within that group that will respond to different stimuli. It was a red herring to assume that the average acceptance rate for bar coupons could be generalized amongst a broader population. As we began to break down the elements of the drivers, we found what traits would lead to higher acceptance rates. We now know a little bit more about who target with bar coupons. This informs us we should do a similar exercise for the other coupon types. If we repeat this process we can improve our overall coupon acceptance rate by targeting those more likely to accept the type of coupon we send them"

In the following image, you will see that when it concerns coupons for expensive restaurants if given the opportunity those with a partner are more likely to accept the coupon. This is likely due to the fact that these individuals would love the chance to treat their partner to a nicer meal. I found this finding quite wholesome.\n",

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I found that we can increase the rate of acceptance for expensive restaurant coupons by targeting certain attributes in the dataset. Proximity and direction had a moderate impact on acceptance but income showed no correlation (barring 1 income bracket).  Particularly, relationship dynamics were of keen interest to me. People with partners but not married were more likely to accept a coupon. There was a gender dynamic going on here too. Both genders were out to impress, however females of lower income had a stronger boost than males of a lower. These findings suggest that targeting couples, particularly those with partners present would be more effective than targeting other dynamics. The data reveals a wholesome pattern where both females and males are more likely to accept a coupon to treat their partners to a nice meal."

    "## Expensive Restaurant Coupon Acceptance Model Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to create two models for expensive restaurant coupon acceptance. A decision tree and a random forest model. For these models, I decided to only look at the columns I analyzed. I wanted to see if there was a difference between the two models, since I have seen the difference before at work. I fully expected the random forest to perform better. I found that the random forest was easier to tune by threshold. It also looks like the decision tree model had no differences between certain thresholds. Because we are only looking to predict the coupon acceptance, I believe precision metric should be our best metric. From these models, the max precision was 70% and I would recommend that for use. Precision will help minimize the number of false positives. In this case, people who we predict will accept but actually decline the coupon. From a business perspective, this means more efficient targeting. We will reduce the feeling of spam from sending coupons to less likely to accept individuals. However the poor recall metric will mean we will have a lot of missed opportunities. This should be a target area for future research. With better feature discover we should end up with a better model.\n",
